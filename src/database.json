    "answer": "Any and all complaints of inappropriate workplace conduct within the Legislature can be submitted to the WCU for review and assessment.

    "question": "Do I have to discuss my complaint with my supervisor or my house's Human Resources office before contacting the WCU?",

If you feel comfortable doing so, you may report your concern or complaint with your supervisor and/or Human Resources Office, but you are not required to do so. It should be noted that supervisors and managers are required to report any complaints of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation they receive to the WCU."

    "question": "What about inappropriate conduct not related to a protected class? How do I report that?",
    "answer": "You can report any type of complaint about workplace conduct to your house's Human Resources office.

    "question": "Can my confidentiality be guaranteed?",
    "answer": "The WCU maintains the confidentiality of investigations to the greatest extent possible. Complete confidentiality may not be possible because it may be necessary for an investigator to disclose certain information obtained during the course of an investigation in order to conduct a thorough investigation. It should be noted that certain documents will be released in cases where sexual harassment claims have been substantiated against a Member or a high-level legislative employee, and the house has imposed discipline or has determined that the allegations are well-founded based on the Panel's findings. The documents to be released will be the claim filed and the letter provided to the subject of the investigation, which will include a summary of the Panel's factual findings. All documents will redact the personally identifying information of the accuser and witnesses, for privacy reasons."
  },
  "6": {
    "question": "Are there methods for complaining about discrimination other than through the WCU, Human Resources, or my supervisor?",
    "answer": "Yes.  Complaints of unlawful conduct related to a protected class can be filed directly with the California Civil Rights Department (CRD, formerly the Department of Fair Employment and Housing) or the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). You can contact CRD through their website at https://calcivilrights.ca.gov or 1-800-884-1684. You can contact the EEOC at https://www.eeoc.gov or 1-800-669-4000."
